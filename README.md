# YouTok

### Deprecated: This project was using a free trial (Sanity) for a backend. That free trail has expired.

I'm fascinated by random Youtube videos with no views, so I made this web app to view, write notes/comments, and store these videos onto a Sanity database. It's pretty much a Youtube/Tiktok clone, except for this niche use case.

## Features

- Play and search for random Youtube vidoes with no views.

- Save/Like videos for later.

- Add notes/comments on any video (stored within the app, not on Youtube).
