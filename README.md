# YouTok

I'm fascinated by random Youtube videos with no views, so I made this web app to view, write notes/comments, store these videos onto a Sanity database. It's pretty much a Youtube/Tiktok clone, except for this niche use case.
## Features

- Play and search for random Youtube vidoes with no views.

- Add notes/comments on any video (stored within the app, not on Youtube). 
- See what videos other users have liked or commented on.
